ItemImpl objects now have a WeightMax and VolumeMax, which is the maximum carry.
ItemContainer objects have had these properties removed as implemented in super class ItemImpl.
Pros
- We don't need to check the item type before asking the max carrying volume/weight as all items
now have this feature.

Weights and Volumes are now objects.
Pros 
- should allow for future support of multiple units of weight e.g. SI and Imperial.
- possibly tighter control over weights and volumes in the future.
Cons 
- slower and more work to maintain.
- some risk of use of null pointer.
