Started on Javadoc.
Trying to get deep persistence to work for ItemContainer.

2012-07-16
Location objects are back and based on ItemContainer.
Most references to Item have been replaced with ItemImpl so that the correct 
version of equals() is run.

2012-07-12
Location class removed. location property is now just an Item.
Fixed a bug in ItemImpl's equals().

Working on persistence - Started adding serialisation.
Started fixing a bug in ItemImpl's equals().
Added lots of null_safe_compare() static methods to allow easy equals() checks.

ItemImpl objects now have a WeightMax and VolumeMax, which is the maximum carry.
ItemContainer objects have had these properties removed as implemented in super class ItemImpl.
Pros
- We don't need to check the item type before asking the max carrying volume/weight as all items
now have this feature.

Weights and Volumes are now objects.
Pros 
- should allow for future support of multiple units of weight e.g. SI and Imperial.
- possibly tighter control over weights and volumes in the future.
Cons 
- slower and more work to maintain.
- some risk of use of null pointer.
