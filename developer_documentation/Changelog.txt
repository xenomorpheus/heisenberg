2012-11-20
IItem (Item Interface) and IItemContainer (Item Container Interface) 
have been fixed so that they only mention IItem not Item, and IItemContainer 
not ItemContainer.  Item and ItemContainer have been updated to match.
Unit tests updated to match.

All Item related classes have had equals() updated to only rely on the
UUID.

The result of the UUID, clones are no longer equals() to the original
object.

Clothing added to several classes so that they may be worn by a Humanoid.

Item name and description are now optional.

Humanoid class' getIndexOfChild has been added.

2012-11-19
All Item objects now have an ID.
This was needed because UI code needs to be able to call getIndexOfChild,
  which requires being able to tell the difference between two objects with the same properties.
  E.g. consider a Quiver and 5 identical arrows are inserted then getIndexOfChild() called 
  on the third arrow, which must return 2 (zero offset).
  Used globally pseudo-unique Id generator.
  http://www.java2s.com/Code/Java/Development-Class/GeneratepseudoGUIDsequences.htm

  To have objects with world pseudo unique identifiers with the following properties:
  * Multiple isolated systems can generate globally (almost guaranteed unique) UIDs.
  * No dependency between systems, e.g. no shared databases, or services.
  * Later it would be fairly simple to move objects between systems without changing the UID,
     or at least very little renumbering.

2012-11-18
PowerWord classes are once again separate from Skill classes.
2012-11-15

2012-07-08
ItemImpl objects now have a WeightMax and VolumeMax, which is the maximum carry.
ItemContainer objects have had these properties removed as implemented in super class ItemImpl.
Pros
- We don't need to check the item type before asking the max carrying volume/weight as all items
now have this feature.

Weights and Volumes are now objects.
Pros 
- should allow for future support of multiple units of weight e.g. SI and Imperial.
- possibly tighter control over weights and volumes in the future.
Cons 
- slower and more work to maintain.
- some risk of use of null pointer.
