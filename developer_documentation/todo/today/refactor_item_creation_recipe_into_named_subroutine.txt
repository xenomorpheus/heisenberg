Changes to the Recipe / Cooker mechanism.
Effectively this will merge Item creation and subroutine into one simplified solution.

Overview:
Create RecipeRoutine package to hold subroutines.
Convert Item creation into a named subroutine in the config.

Idea:
New types of ingredients - place-holders.
Move existing ingredients from vector to a Set with named entries.
Some mechanism to auto generate names and descriptions based on properties.
Recipe for item creation becomes folded into normal spell, calling the item creation spell (subroutine).

Also ingredients to have names.

name :newItemLocation
description : String : The location of the new item.
type : IItemContainer
consumed: false

name : target
description : String : The target of the spell.
type : IItem
consumed: false
