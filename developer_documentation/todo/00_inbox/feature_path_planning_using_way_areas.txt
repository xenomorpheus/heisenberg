Idea:

Firstly divide the land to be travelled into 'way areas'.
  One way to do this may be to use the vision code to determine the edges of walls.
  Use wall edges to create way points.
  Use way points as the corners of polygons that are the way areas.

Next use these way areas as points in the path finding problem.

Using an ordered list of way areas, somehow construct a reasonably optimised path through these way areas.
  Perhaps some kind of spline calculation.
