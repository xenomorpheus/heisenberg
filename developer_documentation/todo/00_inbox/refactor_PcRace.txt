Race refactored to Player
Consider removing all Human, Halfling, Elf, etc. and replace with enum Race.
Player class to have a field race which is enum Race.
Greatly simplifies UI Pc editor.
Allows changing of race without removing and reinserting PC object.
Currently no race based properties anyway.

Alternatively PC Editor can now handle different classes. This may be good 
as future classes may not be humanoid.
