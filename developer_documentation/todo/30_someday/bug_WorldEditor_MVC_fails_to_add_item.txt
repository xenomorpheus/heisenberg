There is a bug in the WorldEditor that the add button doesn't end up adding 
the item to the view.
There looks to be problems in some cases when adding items to containers in tree view.

No changes shown. Possibly JTree not being notified of change events.

For ideas on how to fix the bug, review the MVC JTree Mutable Example.
