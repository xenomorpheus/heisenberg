Is it a problem that Item equals() function can't tell the difference between different objects with the same properties?

e.g. Arrow objects in a quiver.

Does it actually matter getting the wrong object? 
Perhaps normally no.

What about UI when getIndexOfChild() returns the first object it finds.
Example problem, quiver full of arrows returns the wrong ID when an arrow added.

The test I am using is:
Create object x.
Add object x into container at position y.
Ask container why position in container is item x, should respond with y.

Test with a Quiver and adding Arrow objects.
