Redesign the Classes for holding PCs (player characters), Race, EntityItem.

Note that fifthed packages are entirely different to entity packages.
Redesign classes within entity packages, not fifthed packages.

Remove entity.CharacterSheet from inheritance.

Make CharacterSheet a property of EntityItem.
* redirect EntityItem calls to get/set name/description to the CharacterSheet.

Refactor/create entity.CharacterSheet class from Race class
* use type composition rather than type inheritance.
* has_a Species instance.

Perhaps Player should be an interface.

Perhaps create a HumanoidPlayer interface.
* Combines both Player and Humanoid interfaces.


Perhaps create a Humanoid interface rather than class.

Race refactored to CharacterSheet
Consider removing all Human, Halfling, Elf, etc. and replace with enum Race.
Player class to have a field race which is enum Race.
Greatly simplifies UI Pc editor.
Allows changing of race without removing and reinserting PC object.
Currently no race based properties anyway.

Alternatively PC Editor can now handle different classes. This may be good
as future classes may not be humanoid.
