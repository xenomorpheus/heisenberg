Issue Description:
There seems to be a difference between running in VSCode and from the command line.

Ideally I want to move seamlessly between developing in both command line and VSCode.
* running code
* running unit tests

Frequently getting Java linking errors with java version differences between classes

* I need to run the tests from the same environment in which they were built in.
    e.g choose either VSCode or command line.
* When switching between environments:
    * running mvn clean
    * removing database
    * sometime removing ~/.m2

Identified that VSCode is using a Java compiler/jre that isn't in the Mac's
list of java versions.
  JAVA_HOME="/usr/local/Cellar/openjdk/23.0.1/libexec/openjdk.jdk/Contents/Home/"

Remedies for java version compatibility
* Sometimes I run "mvn clean".
* Sometimes I remove entire third-party packages e.g. rm -r ~/.m2

--------------------------
Issue Resolution:
* VSCode uses an embedded JDK provided by brew that doesn't appear in java_home
      command output.
* Identify the JDK from the output of VSCode during compilation.
* Set the JAVA_HOME to that of the JDK identified above.
