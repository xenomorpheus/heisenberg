Notes for future development on Memory for Entity.


Barrier Class

Method - getRestrictionDetails  ( Vec2  movement)
  returns null if won't block.
  returns a scaled version of 'movement' vector that intersects with the barrier.
  // TODO currently movement is a point mass so this approach may fail if barrier has a gap which is too small for entity to fit through.
  // TODO in future consider movement of shapes through.
  // Perhaps best left to the physics engine.
