AI Cat
Agent - cat s/w



f(n) = g(n) + h(n)

f(n) = the evaluation (of a node) function.
g(n) = the cost from the start node to the current node (n).
h(n) = the estimated cost from the current node to the goal.



Ideas for units to measure state evaluation (f/g/h)
=========================================================

Energy:
Energy expended (e.g. living plus any movment) is bad (positive ?)
Energy gained (e.g. eating) is good (negative)
What about coming up with a negative total ?
Energy may not be a good measure.
Is twice the energy, twice as good (happy) ?
Money:  Double money doesn't give double happiness.



Ideas for h(n)


h(n)
= a1 * "health / happiness" of agent.
+ a2 * "health / happiness" of "friends" ?
+ a2 * "health / happiness" of environment


Health and happiness of agent
===============================
h(n)
= a1 * metric(hydration)
+ a2 * metric(nourishment)

Future:
rest, aeration etc.

Idea:
a1, a2, etc. should be computed via RL (Reinforcement Learning).





Ideas for computing health metric coeffecients a1, a2.
===========================================================
a1, a2, etc. should be computed via RL (Reinforcement Learning).

initial a1 based on time to die from lack of hydration.
initial a1 based on time to die from lack of nourishment.

Use RL to fine tune.

Setup unit tests for sevaral situations to check reasonable values
for overal health / happiness.





Action Item
=================================
Add Items:
Fungus (Item sub-class) - DONE
Rat (Entity sub-class) - DONE
Cat (Entity sub-class) - DONE


Entity Properties:
aeration                   ideal 100 - DONE
hydration                  ideal 100 - DONE
nourishment                ideal 100 - DONE
rest                       ideal 100 - DONE
entertainment              ideal 100 - DONE




Detailed Plans
=====================================

Should cat be Born with racial memory?
Tendency to hunt / drink / eat /sleep
If so, how ?
Perhaps the co-efficients on the metrics for state evaluation functions.

h(n) 
= a1 * distance_to_smaller_animal_when_hungry(n)
+ a2 * distance_to_water_when_thirsty(n)
???




Actions:
Move/run
Pounce
Eat (recipe)
Drink (recipe)
(maybe) Breath - zero action points

Sensors:
See
Hear
Smell

Environment:
Room
Water
Mice
Fish?


Agent goals: (RL features)
0 bad eg. Penalties for low. 
100 ideal
150 max, minor penalties over 100

breath - hi priority, time concept
Temp - concept of ideal body temp
- concept of current temp
- expressed as a function of ideal and current
Health - penalties for low
- some waiting of breath, fed, rested, etc

Identify: (goals)
Threats
Opportunities (based on needs)
