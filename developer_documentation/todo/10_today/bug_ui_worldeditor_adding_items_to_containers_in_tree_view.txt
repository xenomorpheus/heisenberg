There looks to be problems in some cases when adding items to containers in tree view.

Bug 1:
No changes shown. Possibly JTree not being notified of change events.


Bug 2:
This is an old bug.  Verify once above bug is fixed.


An attempt was made to add an item to location 3, when there were 0 items already in the container.
Ideas:
* Lots more testing.
* Perhaps add debug output:
a) describe the initial structure.
b) when an item is added or removed.
