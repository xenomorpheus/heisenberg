* Consider deprecate ActionMovement in favour of ActionImpulse.

* Actions are typically paired with a cost.

* Tune the cat and environment so that friction, momentum etc. are more realistic.

* The applied force (on the cat) should be to correct desired direction and speed.

* Increasing the amount of applied force could translate into geometrically increasing additional cost.
   * e.g. faster speeds have more energy drain.

* There should also be a 'living' cost.

* No applied force should be a choice, but will still have the living cost.
   * friction etc. will still be applied by physics engine.

* Impulse should have multiple choices (not all valid)
   a range impulses - Start planning with none, low, medium, high.  Consider fine tune in planning.
   a range of desired directions - Start with 4, then consider fine tune in planning.

* Extra energy reserves could be simplifed to fat reserves, which would have weight.

* Impulse cost would raise with extra weight.

* Entity Weight could be the sum of:
  * base weight
  * fat (energy reserves)
  * water
  * Carried items

* Fat reserves could be simplifed into a measure of base weight (before energy, water, carried load).


Interesting Test cases
* Running vs. walking to water.
