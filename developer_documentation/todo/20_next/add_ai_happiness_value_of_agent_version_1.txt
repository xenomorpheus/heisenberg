Health and happiness of agent
===============================
h(n)
= a1 * metric(hydration)
+ a2 * metric(nourishment)

Future:
rest, aeration etc.

Idea:
a1, a2, etc. should be computed via RL (Reinforcement Learning).


Ideas for computing health metric coeffecients a1, a2.
===========================================================
a1, a2, etc. should be computed via RL (Reinforcement Learning).

initial a1 based on time to die from lack of hydration.
initial a1 based on time to die from lack of nourishment.

Use RL to fine tune.

Setup unit tests for sevaral situations to check reasonable values
for overal health / happiness.


Entity Properties:
aeration                   ideal 100
hydration                  ideal 100
nourishment                ideal 100
rest                       ideal 100
entertainment              ideal 100
