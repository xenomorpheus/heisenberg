Prerequisite(s):

ability to calculate happiness value of agent.



Ideas for units to measure state evaluation (f/g/h)
=========================================================

Energy:
Energy expended (e.g. living plus any movement) is bad (positive ?)
Energy gained (e.g. eating) is good (negative)
What about coming up with a negative total ?
Energy may not be a good measure.
Is twice the energy, twice as good (happy) ?
Money:  Double money doesn't give double happiness.



Ideas for h(n)


h(n)
= a1 * "health / happiness" of agent.
+ a2 * "health / happiness" of "friends" ?
+ a2 * "health / happiness" of environment





Detailed Plans
=====================================

Should cat be Born with racial memory?
Tendency to hunt / drink / eat /sleep
If so, how ?
Perhaps the co-efficients on the metrics for state evaluation functions.

h(n) 
= a1 * distance_to_smaller_animal_when_hungry(n)
+ a2 * distance_to_water_when_thirsty(n)
???
