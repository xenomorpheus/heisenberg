One line Scope:
In a game combat, offer the PC good quality choices based on PC abilities, enemy type, enemy location (range), obstacles, etc.

Thoughts:

Will need to work out an effectiveness ranking.

Action Duration Round:

1 Full-round action OR

1 Standard action plus 1 Move action (in any order) OR

2 Move actions (effectively trading your Standard action for a Move action)

Plus a combination of :

1 Swift or Immediate Action AND

Any number of Free Actions

A few special cases
The 5 ft. step
Provided you don't take any other action that actually involves using a move speed (walking/running/flying...) 
during the same round, you can take a 5' step as a free action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity once per round.
